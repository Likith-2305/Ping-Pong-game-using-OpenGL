# Ping-Pong-game-using-OpenGL
A simple single player ping pong game using OpenGL
GLUT files should be installed. 
The project illustrates a ping pong kind of single player game. The application itself opens up to
an introduction page which gives the details about the project. Upon pressing ‘S’, the game starts
with a ball moving downwards. The player is given access to a “BAT” using which the ball must
be stopped from falling down. The ball bounces on the “BAT” and changes it’s direction. The
ball interacts with the edges or invisible “WALLS” and returns downwards again. The player
must continously bounce the ball back to continue playing.
The game has a scoring system where each time the ball interacts with the “BAT”, the score is
increased by 1 unit. There is no levels as of now, but is an idea for improvement.
This project demonstrates how the functions of OpenGL can be used to create simple and fun
games.
